###4x4 Card Game
==============

A fun and interactive 4x4 card matching game built with React. In this game, players need to match pairs of cards in a grid layout. The game is designed to test your memory and speed as you try to find matching pairs while keeping track of your moves and time.

###Features
--------
- 4x4 Grid: A 4x4 grid of cards, shuffled randomly at the start of each game.
- Card Matching: Flip cards and match pairs based on identical images or values.
- Moves Counter: Track the number of moves made during the game.
- Timer: Keep track of the elapsed time during the game session.
- Victory Condition: The game ends when all pairs are matched, and your moves and time are displayed.

###Technologies Used
-----------------
- React: For building the user interface and managing the game state.
- CSS: For styling the game and making it responsive.
- JavaScript: For game logic and functionality (matching cards, move counter, timer).

###How to Play
